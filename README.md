# COVID-19 Data Visualization
Amidst the Coronavirus pandemic, I decided to work in Python and visualize data.

## Motivation/Why
With Coronavirus constantly spreading, I wanted to visualize the data that is coming out to help comprehend everything that is going on.

Unfortunately, data is not very accurate. Governments are releasing data at different rates, not enough testing is being done to give us an accurate estimate of how many cases do not show any symptoms and testing figures are not being released to compare positive and negative results.

This program is written in Python using a Jupyter Notebook.
